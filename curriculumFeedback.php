                <p>I strongly agree that the  course contribute to skilled enhancement and career opportunities. I feel that the course was well structured and organised to achieve the learning outcomes. Labs were well equipped and learning materials were very useful and relevant. I was able to apply the syllabus in real life applications and the course enabled to build your future career. I agree that the classroom environment was supportive enough and Books/Reference materials were relevant.

                <p>  I really felt very strong about the contribution of the course and the study materials were supportive and relevant. This course served to apply the syllabus in real world applications. Teaching hours, Content flow, Access to materials was made possible. I feel that the syllabus was need based and was on fundamental as well as on modern/advanced topics.

                <p>I am very much pleased about the environment in classroom. Programming Labs were well equipped and provided the needful. The application of the syllabus in real life was good enough to build my future career. The syllabus was on advanced topics and was able to achieve the learning outcomes through many tutorials and practicals.
