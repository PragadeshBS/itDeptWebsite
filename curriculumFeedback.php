                <p>We strongly feel that the course has contributed a lot in increasing our skills and career opportunities. It also enables us to build a stable future career and the concepts thought were very helpful in real life situations and projects that we came across in workplace. They further gave a very positive comment on the lab facilities provided by the department. Overall I feel that the course was very well organised and was need based and emphasised on fundamental as well as on modern/advanced topics

            <p>  I am very much pleased with the classroom environment and the lab facilities. I think that the syllabus was need based and focuses on the fundamental as well as on modern/advanced topics. Me and my friends are able to relate the topics to real life application and it also contributes to our skill enhancement and opens more career opportunities for us. I find the course very well organised and the learning materials provided is very useful and provides additional knowledge.

            <p>The course objectives are very clear and the same is reflected in the syllabus.The prescribed books are very well relevant to achieve these objectives.It is thoughtful of the university to give us the freedom to propose, modify and suggest any kind of incorporate change required in the syllabus. Moreover we are very happy with the number of electives provided to the students by the department. I believe strongly that the syllabus enables the students to update their knowledge sufficient enough to survive the present industry.
